# Mediation Analysis

R code is presented that allows a researcher

- to estimate and test the direct effects, indirect effects, a total effect, and to compare effects.
- to calculate effect sizes for all direct effects.
- to estimate power using bootstrap power simulations.

Reference: Ledermann, T., Myriam, R. , & Fritz, M. S. (under review). On partial versus full mediation and the importance of effect sizes.
